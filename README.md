# VIPHPC

To begin, research was done for weeks involving HPC using open ACC. This was for a research course at the University of Delaware. The start of this began with a simple ACC matrix multiplication. No parallelization was involved and it operated as normal. Luckily with OpenACC, we can take functions like these and make them quicker to run.

The "start" file was found online and can be found from many resources as long as you have the time to google. The "end" file is where it became more involved.

My logic behind the way I executed this was that loops are always the most ideal place to parallize.
